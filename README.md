###Technical Details:
* TunedIn allows for users to create a custom profile page,
detail their experience and education, connect with
other users, and create posts. Information from the database is rendered in JSON.


The following table illustrates how I implemented making connections:

## connections
column name      | data type | details
-----------------|-----------|-----------------------
id               | integer   | not null, primary key
connector_id     | integer   | not null, foreign key (references users), indexed
connectee_id     | string    | not null
status           | string    | not null, default: pending

I made it a priority to avoid duplicating data. Accordingly, this table encapsulates both
connection requests and made connections. To do that I had to create
a variety of associations to figure who made the request, who could accept it,
and who would get a notification as a result. It seemed a bit daunting at the
beginning, but after I wrapped my head around it I realized it's not so complicated.
